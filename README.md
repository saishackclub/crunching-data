# Airline Analysis with Python

Hey, we're working on something cool right now... stay tuned!

## What's this workshop about?

We're getting our hands dirty with some airline data. We'll look at everything from the miles flown, the number of passengers, delays, and even stuff like wifi. We'll check out whether it's a weekend flight, how long it took, the type of ticket bought (coach or first-class), and even if it's a red-eye flight.

## What will you learn?

You'll learn how airline prices work and all the different things that can make a flight cheaper or more expensive. You'll get to mess around with some real data, and learn how to find patterns and make smart guesses. You'll come away not just thinking like a travel agent, but also a data analyst, ready to ask the right questions and find cool answers.

**Let's do this!**
